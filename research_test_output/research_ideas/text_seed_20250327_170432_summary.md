## 1. Nonparametric Bernstein Copulas for High-Dimensional Vine Models

Source: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.2043v1

### Summary
The research proposes the use of nonparametric Bernstein copulas in high-dimensional vine models to improve the accuracy and robustness of dependence modeling, particularly in financial applications. The approach eliminates the need for selecting parametric copula families, which can introduce errors. Through simulation studies and empirical analysis, the authors demonstrate that their smooth nonparametric vine copula model outperforms competing parametric vine models calibrated using Akaike's Information Criterion.

### Key Points
- Introduction of nonparametric Bernstein copulas in high-dimensional vine models.
- Elimination of the need for selecting parametric copula families.
- Superior performance of the proposed model over Akaike's Information Criterion-calibrated models.

- Care must be taken to ensure smoothness of density estimates for reliable results.

## 2. Levy Copulas and Pair Copula Constructions for Multivariate Lévy Processes

Source: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4309v2

### Summary
This paper introduces the concept of pair copula constructions (PLCC) for Levy copulas, providing a flexible framework for modeling dependence in multivariate Lévy processes. By decomposing the d-dimensional Levy copula into d(d-1)/2 bivariate functions, only d-1 of which are Levy copulas and the rest distributional, the paper offers enhanced flexibility without restrictive constraints on copula choice. The methodology is supported by detailed estimation and simulation procedures, validated through a Monte Carlo study.
