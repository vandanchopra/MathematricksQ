- Start with understanding the project we're working on by reading the @README.md file associated with the project. but also read in the required files as needed.
- look at the @to_do_list.md and lets start fixing things one by one. 
- Only work on items that do NOT have [COMPLETED] in front of them. 
- After you finish a task, add a [COMPLETED] to it in the front.
- You are not allowed to delete any text from this file, only allowed to read it and add [COMPLETED] to completed tasks.
- Also keep updating the to_do_list.md, for each task, with a set of notes of jobs that have been done by you, so that if we need to start the session again by another LLM, you can read your own notes and see what you have already done. Put all such thoughts and notes in {curly brackets}. Do this 4-5 minutes.
- Always re-read everytime before starting work and after finishing work this file as the human is going to be updating this file and making changes to it.
- Don't be in a hurry to make changes to code, instead, first go into ask mode, spend time reading in as much code as is needed for you to understand the problem as a whole. 
- Then before you start, can you add a step by step instructions in {curley} to the task on to_do_list.md, so that if the work stops mid-way because of roo-code having an issue, then we can start where we left off. 
- Then switch to code mode and start following your instructions, And as you keep wrapping up tasks, keep add [DONE] in front of them as you go.
- And ask the human if the task is completed, and if we should move to the next task.
- IMPORTANT: If the human says yes, then update the readme file of the project, before moving on.
